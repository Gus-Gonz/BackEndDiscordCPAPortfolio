# Back End Discord CPA Portfolio

A discord bot made thanks to Discord.py, where after an user us an specifict commad , it sends an Direct Message with a Token

This is the a Discord bot of a CPA business model I came up a couple of month ago , the main idea is to Keep a Group of loyal users using the popular platform Discord.com , in this platform we will have this discord bot working 24h/7 that it will generate a Token which is later put in a website.

this website makes an animation and CPA offer should pop up and block the ussers to get the Account they came looking for unless they complete 1 Ad.

I used Ogads.com as my main CPA network and with free traffic we manege to get a group of arrounr 600 loyal users , archiving an stable $50-$70 per month (https://imgur.com/a/muQrTzE).

# Before deployment

In case you want to use this bot, you will need to provide the ID of your discord account and you need to generate a token for the dicord bot in the config/config_discord.py before hosting it, you can get the token of your bot from their official site https://discord.com/developers/applications ( you would need an account in their platform to apply)

This Business model host a DB using the online and free service Mongodb.com , there for you will need to provide the Client details , the cluster name and the colection name in the config/config_mongo.py before hosting it , for more info about the functionality of MongoDB use their official documentation https://docs.mongodb.com/
